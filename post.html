                "What is the most worthwhile thing in life?" I chose to read this book based on its title, and surprisingly, it resonated with a question I have been contemplating for a long time: as a human being, what is the meaning of my existence?
            </p>
            <p>
                I often assess the value of events before and after they occur, questioning whether my actions are truly meaningful. Is it worth it? This book, with numerous examples and perspectives, dissects various facets of this question. It doesn't dictate what is right or wrong but, through each story, shares the author's endorsed values, fitting perfectly for someone like me who loves short stories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the reading process, I found inspiration in Hong Lan's perspective. Her view on time made me reflect on the brevity of life. Previously, I tended towards a negative life attitude and had a somewhat one-sided view of the value of life. However, the phrase "better regret doing than regret not doing" deeply struck a chord with me. Assuming I already have a negative outlook on life, why not embrace the "better regret" mindset and courageously try something new? Additionally, the author's analysis of uniqueness and value is impressively presented, subtly reminding the reader with indirect cues. The viewpoint of enduring hardship for future joy prompted me to contemplate recent challenges in my own life, providing substantial guidance.
            <p>
                The chapter that resonated most strongly with me was about the "emotional" issue, quoting Charlie Chaplin: "A joke is not funny after being told three times. Why do we repeat an unpleasant thing in our minds thirty times?" Constantly emphasizing unpleasant things in life is exhausting and despair-inducing. By trapping ourselves, we can only escape the infinite entanglement by learning to release and rescue ourselves. Overall, this book is not just an exposition of various viewpoints but also a guiding compass for reflective thinking, helping me clarify my position and values in life.
            </p>

                This is my first time reading Hong Lan's work, and though I've heard her name frequently, it's only after experiencing her writing that I truly understand the reason for her popularity. With a smooth writing style, rich content, and high readability, I have also started reading "How to Achieve Your Life." Although I haven't finished it yet, I believe it will be a highly beneficial journey. In the past, I resisted directly accepting others' viewpoints and values, but through this non-pressure and pure narrative style, who knows what might change in the future.
